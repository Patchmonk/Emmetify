# Emmetify CSS Framework Roadmap

## Introduction
Welcome to the Emmetify CSS Framework! This project is a labor of love, developed in my spare time. My goal is to create a simple, intuitive, and flexible CSS framework that helps developers prototype and build faster.

As a solo developer, I work on this project when I have the time. I truly appreciate any contributions, feedback, or support from the community. Your involvement can make a big difference in improving and expanding the framework.

Feel free to dive in, explore, and contribute! Together, we can make the Emmetify CSS Framework even better. ðŸ˜Š
